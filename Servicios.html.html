<center><p><font size="4" color="#000000" face="arial">Apartheid was a system of racial segregation that took place in South Africa and Namibian until 1992, and in Rhodesia until 1979. In short, this system of racial segregation consisted of the creation of separate places, both for housing and for study or even recreation, for the different racial groups, in the exclusive power of the white race to exercise the vote and in the prohibition of marriages or even sexual relations between white and black as the data shows us.</font></p></center)

<center><h1><font color="#050A30" face="arial">Who was NELSON MANDELA?</font></h1></center>
</br>
<center><p><font size="4" color="#000000" face="arial">We want you to know the role that Nelson Mandela played in the abolition of the segregation generated by the apartheid system. What was his fight? Was it fair? Did he achieve his goals? 

Let's watch together this interesting timeline and video about Nelson Mandela and his role in the fight for equality.

Segregation was a milestone point in society. However, today a great achievement is that black people can vote and this would have seemed impossible at that time. But here the question is, should we continue the fight that Mandela started? What do you think?</font></p></center)
